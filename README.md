# OSL Knowledgebase

Intended to be a singular repository of researched and fact-checked knowledge about the Osmosis protocol, the Cosmos ecosystem, and beyond.

This repo is maintained by the Osmosis Support Lab for the benefit of the Osmosis community and anyone else who may find it useful.

Proposed policy:

* changes must be submitted via pull request; a pull request must be approved by at least two dedicated reviewers (if submitted by a reviewer, only one other review needed)
* the information contained in this repo will supersede all other official or unofficial OSL documenation
* in keeping with its mandate to support the Osmosis community, the OSL will make a good faith effort to ensure that all information contained in this repo is accurate. if information about a certain subject is ambiguous or unknown, it will be clearly noted

Future updates:

* implement a dedicated process to identify and review questions or concerns from the community
